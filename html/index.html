        <h3><img src="/img/equolo-logo.png"/> Hello folks, this is equolo!</h3>

        <p>My mission is to contribute to a more sustainable world by offering a platform for buyers and sellers who are committed to sustainability to easily find each other.</p>
        <p>I will find and promote shops, businesses, and public and private initiatives that offer socially and environmentally responsible solutions. I want to pin all these places on a map and make them easy to find for the everyday consumer with a mobile phone or laptop.</p>
        <p>So using my map you will be able to truly make a change only by doing responsible purchases, without any particular commitment or resource. </p>
        <p>All you have to do is to follow me in my journey to the discovery of an underworld of sustainable solutions that may be invisible on standard maps.</p>

        <h3>The flying squirrel effect</h3>
        <p>I have once heard about a thing called butterfly effect: apparently the wing flap of a small butterfly in a place could cause a storm on the other side of the world. So I thought, if a tiny insect can do that, a flying squirrel should be able to accomplish even more!</p>
        <p>Here is the butterfly effect of consumerism: It has a huge environmental and social impact not only on our surroundings, but also on the rest of the world  - especially on fragile eco- and social systems.</p>
        <p>And here is the flying squirrel effect of equolo: make use of the places that appear on my map, and you will contribute on a daily basis to a more sustainable planet.</p>
        <p>There is a whole underworld of places that are committed to responsible consumption and production models. They make their best to reduce their impact on the world – so let's help them emerge! 
        <p>Not only is it a way to contribute to a more sustainable world, but also it will support healthy, local, small-scale economies endangered by global competition.</p>

        <h3>Me and your shopping cart</h3>
        <p>I want to do my best to help you in all the areas in which you operate as a consumer.</p>
        <p>I will attend you at the market for the daily shopping, by choosing a restaurant for your lunch break or helping you finding a clothing store whenever you need to buy a t-shirt. I want to point you locations where you can recharge the battery of your electric car, get your shared bike, or even buy a natural body product.</p>
        <p>I will show you responsible businesses in your surroundings, as well as private or public initiatives aimed at making your community more sustainable.</p>
        <p>And when you plan to go on vacation on the other side of the world, I will jump into your suitcase and help you spot the best solutions to be a responsible tourist.</p>

        <h3>Me and the Community of flying squirrels</h3>
        <p>Well, the jump of a flying squirrel can do much, but a big community can do more...My dream is to map the whole world, so I need your help! If you share my mission and want to help my community grow, Take action!</p>
        <p>Do you know any shop, business, initiative, or else that would be good for my map? Ask them to <a href="submit.php">insert their data</a> here or <a href="#contact">contact me</a> and I will take care of the rest. I also welcome any suggestion for improvement!</p>

        <p>As jumping from one place to another to check every single entry on my map is a lot of effort for a flying squirrel alone, please report to me any activity present on my map which you know doesn't comply with some clear sustainability criteria.</p>

<h3 class="on">Let's discover together a sustainable world!</h3>

        <h3>Who is behind me?</h3>
<p>I am no business nor organization, and I have no sponsors nor partners. I am just the product of the passion of two individuals for good causes and technology.</p>
<p>
My trainer Arianna De Mario currently resides in San Francisco, California. She has worked and volunteered in different nonprofit organizations dealing with sustainability issues in a number of European countries, and eventually in the US. In the Silicon Valley she got interested in mobile technology solutions to social and civil problems, and she decided to adopt me.
</p>
<p>
Arianna worked on the idea of this online platform with Andrea Giammarchi, my other trainer, who's responsible for the initial prototype and technical free-time maintainer of the current version of this platform.
</p>

        <h3>Me, used technology, and copyrights &copy;</h3>
<p>While somebody likes pizza and somebody else prefers sushi, I just love eating Open-Source all the day long!</p>
<p>Everything in this website is Open Source indeed <a href="https://github.com/equolo/equolo.org#-equolo">including equolo.org website itself</a>!</p>
<p>However, other services have been used to create this site too, such:</p>
<ul class="content">
  <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, the Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps</li>
  <li><a href="http://open.mapquest.com/">Open MapQuest</a>, an amazing, fast, and beautiful predefined tiles server for the leaflet map engine</li>
  <li><a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> awesomely crafted icons for all general purpose websites</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, of course, for its free support to the whole Open-Source community, including this website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is missing? That could be you, or anyone else, so kind to help me maintain, improve, or contribute to map a more sustainable world!</p>

<h3>What would you like to tell me?</h3>
<p>
Being in here, I believe there's something you'd like to tell me.
</p>
<p>Is it about your business or somebody else's place you believe should be shown on the map?</p>
<p>For this or any other general inquiry, feel free to contact me by email at <span class="email">gro.olou<span>qe@</span>ofni</span> <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></p>

<h3>Maybe you would like to contribute?</h3>
<p>
As every butterfly could flap a hurricane, every squirrel could help this cause.</p>
<p>
My effort is to improve and dedicate as much time as possible to make this idea a concrete reality everywhere around the world. If you would like to help me in this, please make a donation to be part of this community in first person ... any amount matters!

<h3><img src="/img/equolo-logo.png"/> Pin your activity on on the Map</h3>
<p>
Dear shop owner, farmer, business holder, service provider, leader of community initiatives...I am looking for you!
</p>
<p>
I want to pin on my map every private or public activity that is committed to basic sustainability criteria, so that consumers know where they can access products and services which are ethical and environmentally friendly.
</p>
<h3 class="on">Any sort of activity is welcome!</h3>
<p>
Do you share my goal and want to be part of it? Take a few minutes to join the equolo map! Insert basic information on your business and its location, select from the list of sustainability criteria those pertinent to your activity and read and accept the terms of use...That's it, you are on the map!
</p>
<p>
Equolo is a service free of charge. Use the opportunity of being part of a great social movement by promoting your business at the same time!
</p>
<p>
<a href="submit.php"><strong>Let's get started! Jump to the registration form</strong></a> <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i>
</p>
<h3><i class="fa fa-mobile fa-2x"></i> ... and pin it on your device too!</h3>
<p>
HTML5 and the Mobile Web are a great way to have the same app reachable everywhere and without requiring extra software.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, you might want to simplify and link my service on your home screen. You can do it with few steps, accordingly with your device.
</p>
<h3 class="on">equolo.org is also an App</h3>
<h3>iOS7 Home Screen</h3>
<p>
With this beautiful device, using the shortcut gives it also more space for any further time you'll open this service.
Click once on the bottom bar icon:
</p>
<img src="img/iOS7_bottom_bar.png" width="160" height="26"/>
<p>
After, you can simply create the shortcut through the following action:
</p>
<img src="img/iOS7_home_screen.png" width="160" height="85"/>
<p>You can do a similar operation in older versions of iOS by following similar actions:</p>
<img src="img/iOS_home_screen.png" width="150" height="189"/>
<h3>Android Bookmark</h3>
<p>
Right now the save to home screen is experimental in latest Google Chrome Beta for Android and unavailable for all other phones.
</p>
<p>However, it is possible to save this service as bookmark or tab, and reach it back quickly at any time.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="#fullscreen" onclick="window.emit('go:fullscreen')">go full screen</a> by tapping the squirrel to have a proper App fell without the chrome around.</p>
<h3>Windows Phone</h3>
<p>
You can simply pin this page to the start screen as it is, or using a temporary icon that will better look in your screen.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#wp" onclick="window.emit('wp:hs-icon',event)">Here the <strong>big icon</strong> before saving on start screen!</a>
</p>
<img src="img/wp_home_screen.png" width="160" height="220"/>
<h3>FirefoxOS <i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></h3>
<p>
Having this service pinned is a must, specially for ZTE phones with a tiny screen.
A simple click on the bottom right star should do everything without problems.
</p>
<p>
However, for a better icon and a better experience, you can <a href="#ffos" onclick="window.emit('wp:ffos-install',event)">install equolo as App</a> too.
</p>
<h3>Blackberry 10</h3>
<p>
Nothing could be simpler in here, just click the settings icon and pin it to the home.
</p>
<img src="img/bb10_home_screen.png" width="160" height="151"/>
<h3>Other Platforms</h3>
<p>
Many apologies for being unable to provide same service in all known devices out there.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there are very few cases where it didn't make sense to put effort such <em>Asha</em> and its Xpress browser without a usable canvas, no support from leaflet, and not even a GPS in case of 510, or Palm Pre and <em>webOS 2</em>, mainly due lack of touch events and the inability to hack the panning as done in WP7 and IE9 Mobile. However, at least latest, has been tested to ensure some sort of usability overall.
