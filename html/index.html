        <h3><i class="fx-2x icon icon-equolo"></i>Introducing my mission</h3>

        <p>Hallo world, this is equolo the flying squirrel!</p>
        <p>My mission is to contribute to a more sustainable planet by bringing places and activities
        that foster responsible consumption just one click away from customers.</p>
        <p>I promote on my map shops, businesses, and public and private initiatives that offer
        socially and environmentally responsible solutions, so they can be easily found with a
        mobile phone or laptop.</p>

        <h4>Me and your shopping cart</h4>
        <p>With my map it is easy to become a responsible consumer: Just follow me to the market
        for the daily shopping, to the restaurant for your lunch break, and to a clothing store if
        you need to buy a t-shirt. I will help you spot locations where to recharge the battery of
        your electric car, get your shared bike, and where to buy natural body products.</p>
        <p>I will show you responsible businesses in your sourroundings, as well as private or public
        initiatives aimed at making your community more sustainable.</p>
        <p>And when you plan to go on vacation on the other side of the world, I will jump into your
        suitcase and help you spot the best solutions to be a responsible tourist.</p>

        <p><a href="categories.php" target="_blank">Check out all the categories included in my map</a></p>

        <p>There is a hidden world of places that are committed to responsible consumption and
        production models around you. They make their best to reduce their impact on the world
        – so let's help them emerge!</p>

        <h3>Wanna help me?</h3>
        <p>A flying squirrel alone can't do much, but a big community can change the world...so I
        need your help!</p>
        <ul class="help">
          <li><strong>suggest</strong>: Do you know any shop, business, initiative, or else that would be good
          for my map? Ask them to insert their data here ... or let me know about them
          here ...and I will take care of the rest.</li>
          <li><strong>spread</strong> the word about the service: the more we are, the greater the impact!</li>
          <li><strong>report</strong> to me any activity present on my map which you know doesn't comply
          with some clear sustainability criteria.</li>
          <li><strong>donate</strong>: I am a nonprofit project, so any donation will help me to bring my
          mission forward</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Me, used technology, and copyrights &copy;</h3>
<p>While somebody likes pizza and somebody else prefers sushi, I just love eating Open-Source all the day long!</p>
<p>Everything in this website is Open Source indeed <a href="https://github.com/equolo/equolo.org#-equolo">including equolo.org website itself</a>!</p>
<p>However, other services have been used to create this site too, such:</p>
<ul class="content">
  <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, the Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps</li>
  <li><a href="http://open.mapquest.com/">Open MapQuest</a>, an amazing, fast, and beautiful predefined tiles server for the leaflet map engine</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, of course, for its free support to the whole Open-Source community, including this website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is missing? That could be you, or anyone else, so kind to help me maintain, improve, or contribute to map a more sustainable world!</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>For any questions, suggestions, curiousity, please contact me <span class="email">gro.olou<span>qe@</span>ofni</span> <i class="icon icon-envelope"></i></p>
<p>You can also follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/equolo" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <i class="icon icon-twitter"></i> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/equolo" target="_blank">Facebook</a> <i class="icon icon-facebook"></i></p>

<h4>Who is behind me?</h4>
<p>I am no business nor organization, and I have no sponsors nor partners. I am just the
product of the passion of two individuals for good causes and technology.</p>
<p>My trainers Arianna and Andrea have worked respectively with sustainability issues and
web solutions in a number of European countries. Then they moved to San Francisco,
California, and decided to adopt me.</p>

<h4>Is my homework problematic?</h4>
<p>
Maybe I've been such a bad developer you would like to help me improving this whole service?
</p>
<p>
Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/equolo/equolo.org#-equolo" target="_blank">file an issue on github</a> <i class="icon icon-github"></i> or contribute with any improvement you might have for me, thank you!

<h3><i class="fx-2x icon icon-mobile"></i> equolo.org as an App</h3>
<p>To use equolo.org on your mobile device you can simply save it to your home screen just following one of these instructions.</p>
<h3>iOS7 Home Screen</h3>
<p>
With this beautiful device, using the shortcut gives it also more space for any further time you'll open this service.
Click once on the bottom bar icon:
</p>
<img src="img/iOS7_bottom_bar.png" width="160" height="26"/>
<p>
After, you can simply create the shortcut through the following action:
</p>
<img src="img/iOS7_home_screen.png" width="160" height="85"/>
<p>You can do a similar operation in older versions of iOS by following similar actions:</p>
<img src="img/iOS_home_screen.png" width="150" height="189"/>
<h3>Android Bookmark</h3>
<p>
Right now the save to home screen is experimental in latest Google Chrome Beta for Android and unavailable for all other phones.
</p>
<p>However, it is possible to save this service as bookmark or tab, and reach it back quickly at any time.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="#fullscreen" onclick="window.emit('go:fullscreen')">go full screen</a> by tapping the squirrel to have a proper App fell without the chrome around.</p>
<h3>Windows Phone</h3>
<p>
You can simply pin this page to the start screen as it is, or using a temporary icon that will better look in your screen.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#wp" onclick="window.emit('wp:hs-icon',event)">Here the <strong>big icon</strong> before saving on start screen!</a>
</p>
<img src="img/wp_home_screen.png" onclick="window.emit('wp:hs-icon',event)" width="160" height="220"/>
<h3>FirefoxOS</h3>
<p>
Having this service pinned is a must, specially for ZTE phones with a tiny screen.
A simple click on the bottom right star should do everything without problems.
</p>
<p>
However, for a better icon and a better experience, you can <a href="#ffos" onclick="window.emit('wp:ffos-install',event)">install equolo as App</a> too.
</p>
<h3>Blackberry 10</h3>
<p>
Nothing could be simpler in here, just click the settings icon and pin it to the home.
</p>
<img src="img/bb10_home_screen.png" width="160" height="151"/>
<h3>Other Platforms</h3>
<p>
Many apologies for being unable to provide same service in all known devices out there.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there are very few cases where it didn't make sense to put effort such <em>Asha</em> and its Xpress browser without a usable canvas, no support from leaflet, and not even a GPS in case of 510, or Palm Pre and <em>webOS 2</em>, mainly due lack of touch events and the inability to hack the panning as done in WP7 and IE9 Mobile. However, at least latest, has been tested to ensure some sort of usability overall.
