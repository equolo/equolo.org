        <h3><img src="/img/equolo-logo.png"/> Hello folks, this is equolo!</h3>

        <p>My mission is to contribute to a more sustainable world by offering a platform for buyers and sellers who are committed to sustainability to easily find each other.</p>
        <p>I will find and promote shops, businesses, and public and private initiatives that offer socially and environmentally responsible solutions. I want to pin all these places on a map and make them easy to find for the everyday consumer with a mobile phone or laptop.</p>
        <p>So using my map you will be able to truly make a change only by doing responsible purchases, without any particular commitment or resource. </p>
        <p>All you have to do is to follow me in my journey to the discovery of an underworld of sustainable solutions that may be invisible on standard maps.</p>

        <h3>The flying squirrel effect</h3>
        <p>I have once heard about a thing called butterfly effect: apparently the wing flap of a small butterfly in a place could cause a storm on the other side of the world. So I thought, if a tiny insect can do that, a flying squirrel should be able to accomplish even more!</p>
        <p>Here is the butterfly effect of consumerism: It has a huge environmental and social impact not only on our surroundings, but also on the rest of the world  - especially on fragile eco- and social systems.</p>
        <p>And here is the flying squirrel effect of equolo: make use of the places that appear on my map, and you will contribute on a daily basis to a more sustainable planet.</p>
        <p>There is a whole underworld of places that are committed to responsible consumption and production models. They make their best to reduce their impact on the world â€“ so let's help them emerge! 
        <p>Not only is it a way to contribute to a more sustainable world, but also it will support healthy, local, small-scale economies endangered by global competition.</p>

        <h3>Me and your shopping cart</h3>
        <p>I want to do my best to help you in all the areas in which you operate as a consumer.</p>
        <p>I will attend you at the market for the daily shopping, by choosing a restaurant for your lunch break or helping you finding a clothing store whenever you need to buy a t-shirt. I want to point you locations where you can recharge the battery of your electric car, get your shared bike, or even buy a natural body product.</p>
        <p>I will show you responsible businesses in your surroundings, as well as private or public initiatives aimed at making your community more sustainable.</p>
        <p>And when you plan to go on vacation on the other side of the world, I will jump into your suitcase and help you spot the best solutions to be a responsible tourist.</p>

        <h3>Me and the Community of flying squirrels</h3>
        <p>Well, the jump of a flying squirrel can do much, but a big community can do more...My dream is to map the whole world, so I need your help! If you share my mission and want to help my community grow, Take action!</p>
        <p>Do you know any shop, business, initiative, or else that would be good for my map? Ask them to insert their data here ... or let me know about them here ...and I will take care of the rest. I also welcome any suggestion for improvement!</p>

        <p>As jumping from one place to another to check every single entry on my map is a lot of effort for a flying squirrel alone, please report to me any activity present on my map which you know doesn't comply with some clear sustainability criteria.</p>

        <h3 class="on">Let's discover together a sustainable world!</h3>

        <h3>Who is behind me?</h3>
<p>I am no business and no organization, and I have no sponsors nor partners. I am just the product of the passion of two individuals for good causes and technology. To learn more about them, just send me a private message through my contact form.</p>

        <h3>Me, used technology, and copyrights &copy;</h3>
<p>While somebody likes pizza and somebody else prefers sushi, I just love eating Open-Source all the day long!</p>
<p>Everything in this website is Open Source indeed <a href="https://github.com/equolo/equolo.org#-equolo">including equolo.org website itself</a>!</p>
<p>However, other services have been used to create this site too, such:</p>
<ul class="content">
  <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, the Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps</li>
  <li><a href="http://open.mapquest.com/">Open MapQuest</a>, an amazing, fast, and beautiful predefined tiles server for the leaflet map engine</li>
  <li><a href="http://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a> awesomely crafted icons for all general purpose websites</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, of course, for its free support to the whole Open-Source community, including this website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is missing? That could be you, or anyone else, so kind to help me maintain, improve, or contribute to map a more sustainable world!</p>
