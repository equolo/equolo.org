 ... discovering a sustainable world


### About

This repository contains basically everything related to [equolo.org](http://equolo.org/) project.

The website has been rushed on free time over a couple of week ends and during the evening for fun and no-profit.
The quality of the whole website is not high level, used practices aren't that special too.

We could not wait to show this to the world, that's why we decided to go out even in such state.
Something maybe useful as hint about how you should, or should not do things.

The only file that is missing is the one with the database, a file that should not be shown at any time, the only one that could expose community emails, the only field we are trying to protect as much as possible.

Thank you for your interest in this project, every little help will be appreciated.

### TODO

Here a list of known or desired tasks to fix, improve, or change.

  * start within the closest equo-activity instead of Europe
  * an improved horizontal navigation with ordered markers
  * an incremental activity loader (on map end and for outer bigger regions)
  * multi language for the main page (+ option to explicitly choose a language)
  * a better way to test than just the kitchen server
  * event driven refactoring/cleanup specially for equolo.js
  * ssh instead of plain http
  * a mapnik based server to render tiles in the _best equolo_ possible way
  * a smaller/faster, tiles engine for less capable devices
